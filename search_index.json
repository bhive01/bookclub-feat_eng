"],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter). This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

The answer might be the in the way the predictors are presented to the model.

Preface) What are the possible ways to acheive a better performance? transform the predictors with special functions (log/exp) add an interaction term (prod/ratio) add a functional tranformation (splines/poly) add a re-representation of the predictors (mean/med/standardz) imputing missing values (knn/bagging) Disclaimer: Risk of Overfitting! "],["nature-of-modeling.html", "1.3 Nature of modeling", " 1.3 Nature of modeling The estimation of uncertainty/noise is another very important step to take. “If a model is only 50% accurate should it be used to make inferences or predictions?” The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability is important, a neural network model might be less explicable but can provide a higher level of accuracy. Feature engineering is a matter of choice in finding the most suitable variable transformation for the best performance.

Data originates from an experiment from Hill et al. (2007), a study on “Impact of Image Segmentation on High-Content Screening Data Quality for SK-BR-3 Cells.” BMC Bioinformatics. The data set includes a Case vector containing Train and Test variables, with a total of 61 different vectors, about cellular structures and morphology. Selected for this first example are two predictors: EqSphereAreaCh1 and PerimCh1. The objective is to predict shape parameters of poorly-segmented (PS) and well-segmented (WS) cells from the Class variable.
